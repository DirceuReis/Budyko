This project uses the concept developed by Budyko that the long-term mean value of ratio between actual evapotranspiration and precipitation can be estimated based upon te long-term mean annual value of the ratio between potential evapotranspiration and precipitation, also known as dryness index, to estimate the following:

1. partition of P into Q and E in gauged and ungauged sites
2. relative changes in Q due to changes in P and ETP because of climate changes
3. separate the contributions of climate change and vulnerability from the contributions of land use and land cover changes in the observed changes in mena annual flows
